## About the Company

Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and is well-expanded into other countries.

To strengthen their analytics capability, they plan to expand their data analytics team by hiring junior data analysts.

Tony Sharma, the Data Analytics Director, has designed an SQL challenge to evaluate both technical and soft skills of potential candidates.
